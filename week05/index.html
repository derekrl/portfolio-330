            <li>Apparently some jest expects need to be in arrow functions? First fails, second succeeds

            <li>Jest output: is there a way to make it summarize its results more succinctly? It very quickly floods out
                any reasonably-sized terminal window</li>

                were being asked to do and 10% doing it</li>
            <li>I still don't see any valid reasoning for us to be using specifically touch events when that makes it
                unusable on desktops and most laptops. I know mobile-first is a thing but that's -first not -only</li>
