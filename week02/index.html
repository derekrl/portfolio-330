            <li>Quotation marks: single or double? Does it matter?</li>
            <li>What's a realistic use case for symbols?</li>
            <li>Spacing. Operators, x=1 or y = 2? Template literals, ${var} or ${ var }?<br>Is it just a readability
                thing, or does it go deeper?</li>

                up many opportunities for shorthands</li>
            <li>N-dimensional arrays solve an issue I was looking at for the main index page so more than one sub-page
                could be linked per week. Just need to read them in a flexible way</li>
            <li>...which can be simply managed with the rest operator from the looks of it</li>
